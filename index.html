        <h2>'The map is not the territory' is almost a rhetoric phrase one could notice ringing in the rooms of universities and supposedly rational forums. Penned by Alfred Korzybski in one of his works titled 'General Semantics', the phrase aged to become a seminal piece. Little did the world know about the effect of an idea as strong as that. </h2>

        <h2>            The complete excerpt reads, "A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness." The idea conveyed by Korzybski through the sentence comes close to how I perceive documentations of the 'past' and as by extension, history itself. 
        </h2>

            <h2>Parallelly, I sometimes seek the company and guidance of my younger-self. People often seem to desire the wisdom they’d have a few years from now, I believe in it too. <i>Although, there’s something about the  combination of being oblivious to worldly consequences and believing in simple things that renders an adequate amount of doubt and courage to make some decisions and act on it.</i> </h2>
            
            <h2>'My younger-self' is best represented by an accumulation of decisions, thoughts and importantly, the gaps between the two often expressed in words that can be found in the corners and crevices of my files, digital or otherwise. </h2>

            
            <h2>Thus,  here's my <i> proof of being.</i> </h2>
