        <h2>We visited a mall during Christmas last year, and it was both wonderful and a bit overwhelming to see so many families out in good spirits, spending time with their loved ones. Honestly, it was great.

            But something caught my attention (and probably that of several others, though perhaps for different reasons) at the mall.
            
            Large mascots—a snowman, Santa, and a reindeer—were strolling around. They were adorable, and their playful gait was a joy to watch. Naturally, they were surrounded by crowds of people trying to take photos and shake hands.
            
            Initially, I was a bit skeptical about people touching the mascots' voluminous suits. It seemed a little bothersome that some were actively pushing and posing for photos. Although, I soon started seeing the excitement that allowed people to touch, shake hands, and hug. It felt like a sense of curiosity that had been buried deep down was called upon in people.
            
            I’d seen faces that looked like they’d never have struck a smile at a mall pull their smile now all the way back to the ears. Smile is a strange thing; it emphasises the similarities between everyone so well. I could see it in the eyes that were taken off of the weight of decades of sight. There was a truly present experience in all of them. Sometimes, I think, the ability to find joy in simple things is just as important as moving the heaviest rocks on the planet.</h2>
